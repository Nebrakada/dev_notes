# Spring IoC Container

## Inversion of Control

**Inversion of Control (IoC) = Dependency Injection (DI)**

IoC is a process in which objects define their dependencies only through constructor arguments, arguments to a factory method or properties that are set on the object instance after it is contructed or returned from a factory method.
The container then injects those dependecies when it creates the bean.
