# Spring Framework - Core

**Heart of the Spring Framework.**

## History

* Created as a respons to the complexity of the early J2EE specifications
* Spring is complementary to Java EE
* Spring integrates selected individual specifications from the EE umbrella

## Design philosophy

> Cloud friendly way with the Servlet container embedded and trivial to change

1. Provice choice at every level - defer design decisions as late as possible.
For example, switch persistence providers through configuration without changing code.
2. Accomodate diverse perspectives - embrace flexibility and not opinionated view on how things should be done. 
*Note that Spring Boot provides a quick and opinionated way to create a production-ready Spring-based application.*
3. Maintain strong backward compatibility.
4. Care about API design.
5. Set high standards for code quality.
6. Provide strong testability.
