# Tim Ferriss keynotes 

## Epizode 375 - Josh Waitzkin

1. **Deliberate practice matters.**
Purposeful and systematic practice with focused attention aimed at improving performance.

2. **Finishing strong.**
The last thing you do is what is going to burn into most deeply overnight.

3. **Unconscious learning.**
Linked with the previous point.

4. **Have a sense of what your actual mental performance is.**
In every discipline with high stakes, intensity, time sensitivity where you have to make decisions you need to feel where you are.

5. **Brilliance comes from thinking.**
Peak performance time should be devoted to thinking - this means no phones after waking up.

6. **Most important question - unconscious search for an answer.**
Phases:
* Think about the MIQ (*ending the day strong*), focus on what matters most, release it and sleep well.
* After waking up preinput concentrate on it, no phones, no news, concentrate on the question.
* Writing down the question is important, it could be a journal.
* As a habit, this could be performed in various situations in which you pose an important question, release your mind and come back to is afterwards.

7. **Most important question - gap analysis.**
When working with MIQs, it is important to get feedback after a week or two - think what the MIQ was from the elevated perspective and then measure the gap between the seemingly MIQ and what the real one.

8. **Most imporant question - formulating.**
The form of the question is an open thing - it could be a tactical question, a question about a person, a conrete one.
Usually people are proficient in many parts of a field of mastery and there is one area in which they are stuck.
This area is a great area for MIQ.

9. **The art of letting go.**
Think about the question and then release the mind.
Great fighters are very relaxed when not fighting, almost sleeping before fight and then activate heavily for the fight.
The art is to be a 10/10 when neccessary and be relaxed in other circumstances.
Ability to avoid the simmering 6 directly affects the ability to ratchet up and get to 10.

10. **Escaping from too much input to be more receptive.**
Leaving a place with too much crowd can make you open pores that make you more receptive and see more.

11. **The goal of unobstructed self expression.**
Firstly getting to know who we are and what is the self expression.
Then finding a thing to do which consumes us fully - we are breathing it, we are easting it, we want to train.
