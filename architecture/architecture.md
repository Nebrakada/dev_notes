# Software Architecture

## Why is it important?

Applications lacking a formal architecture are generally:
* tightly coupled;
* brittle;
* difficult to change;
* without a clear vision or direction.

Furthermore, architecture addresses the following questions:
* is the application scalable;
* what are its performance characteristics;
* how easily does it respond to change;
* what are the deployment characteristics;
* how responsive is it.

Without architecture, to determine architectural characteristics of the application one has to fully understand the inner-workings of every component and module in the system.

## Facts

**Overall:**
* Good architecture is almost impossible to get right for the first time.
* Software is never written, it is always rewritten.

**Creating a good design:**
* Let go off the ego.
* Be unemotional.
