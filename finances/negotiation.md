# Negotiation based on *Getting to YES*

## The problem

*Like it or not, you are a negotiator. Negotiation is a fact of life*

### Two ways to negotiate

Facts about negotiation:
* it is not easy to negotiate well;
* negotiation often leaves people dissatisfied, worn out, or alienated.

Common misconception is that there are two ways of negotiating:
* *hard* - seeing any situation as a contest of wills in which the side that takes the more extreme positions and holds out longer fares better;
* *soft* - avoiding personal conflict and making concessions readliy in order to reach an agreement.

**This misconception leads to another one - that negotiation is a trade-off between getting what you want and getting along with people.**

### Bargaining over positions

People routinely engage in positional bargaining:
* each side takes a position, argues for it, and makes concessions to reach a compromise;
* classic example is haggling that takes place between a customer and the proprietor of a secondhand store.

#### Unwise agreements

People tend to lock themselves into positions:
* the more you clarify your position and defend it against attack, the more commited you become to it;
* the more you convince the other side of the impossibility of changing your opening position, the more difficult it becomes to do so;
* **your ego becomes identified with your position**;
* you start to have a new interest in **saving face** - in reonciling future action with past positions.

This all makes it less and less likely that any agreement will wisely reconcile the parties' original interests.

#### Inefficiency

Bargaining over positions takes a lot of time:
* you try to improve the change that any settlement reached is favorable to you by starting with an extreme position, by stubbornly holding to it;
* the process usually involves deceiving the other party as to your true views;
* you make small concessions only as neccessary to keep the negotiation going;
* the process usually involves dragging one's feet, threatening to walk out, stonewalling;
* there is a lot of decision making - a large number of individual decisions as each negotiator decides what to offer, what to reject, and how much of a concession to make.

#### Danger to the relationship

**Positional bargaining becomes a contest of will, each negotiator asserts what the will and won't do.**

This causes the negotiation to turn into a battle. Each side tries through sheer will power to force the other to change its position.

#### Being nice is no answer

Many people see high costs of hard positional bargaining and hope to avoid them by following a more gentle style od negotiation.
This involves:
* seeing the other side as friends;
* emphasizing the necessity of reaching agreement, rather than a goal of victory;
* trusting the other side to be friendly;
* making concessions and offers.

This causes:
* if the parties are friends or family the process tends to be efficient, at least to the extent of producing results quickly;
* **the agreement may not be a wise one**, as each party competes with the other in being more generous and more forthcoming;
* this makes you vulnerable to someone who plays a hard game of positional bargaining.

### Third way to negotiate - principled negotiation

*The answer to the question of whether to use soft positional bargaining or hard is "neither".*

The negotiation usually takes place at two levels:
* the substance;
* the procedure for dealing with the substance - *meta-game*.

**Each move you make within a negotiation is not only a move that deals with rent, salary, etc.; it also helps structure of the rules of the game you are playing.**

There is a third way to negotiate - *principled negotiation*:
* neither hard nor soft, **rather hand and soft**;
* concentrated on looking for mutual gains wherever possible;
* insisting on results based on some fair standards independent of the will of either side;
* hard on the merits, soft on the people;
* employing no tricks and no posturing.

**Principled negotiation shows you how to obtain what you are entitled to and still be decent.**

Principled negotiation is built on the following points:
1. People - separate people from the problem.
2. Interests - focus on interests, not positions.
3. Options - generate a variety of possibilities before deciding what to do.
4. Criteria - insist that the result be based on some objective standard.

In principled negotiation there are three stages:
1. Analysis:
* Diagnose the situation, gather information, organize it, think about it.
* Consider people problems - partisan perceptions, hostile emotions, unclear communication.
* Identify your and the other side's interests.
* Identify options already on the table and any criteria already suggested as a basis for agreement.
2. Planning:
* How do you propose to handle the people problems?
* Of your interests, which are the most important?
* What are some realistic objectives?
* Generate additional options and additional criteria for deciding among them.
3. Discusion:
* The parties communicate back and forth, looking toward agreement.
* Differences in perception, feelings of frustration and anger, difficulties in communication can be acknowledged and addressed.
* Each side should come to understand the interests of the other.
* Both sides can jointly generate options that are mutually advantageous.
* Both sides can jointly seek agreement on objective standards for resolving opposed interests.
