# Test Driven Development (TDD)

Software development process that relies on the repetition of a very short cycle:
1) Requirements are turned into very specific test cases.
2) Software is improved to pass the new tests.
3) Software is refactored provided it still passes tests.

## Unit, end to end and integration tests

## Test-driven development cycle

1) Add a test
* each new feature begins with writing a test;
* to write this test you must understand the feature's specification and requirements;
* this makes developer focus on the requirements *before* writing the code.

2) Run all tests and see if the new one fails
* this validated the test harness is working correctly and rules out the possibility that the new test is flawed and will always pass;
* the new test should fail for the expected reason;
* this step increases developer's confidence in the new test.

3) Implement the feature
*
