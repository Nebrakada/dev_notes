## What counts
* **Rates and reputation are in fairly strict relationship**;
* GitHub profile with some work;
* Code which I am proud of;
* History of projects;
* Specific knowledge;
* Learning fast and finding pointers to the existing knowledge;
* *I started with cheap rates, about $15/hour, and these days charge an average of $60-70/hour*;

## Finding projects
* Word of mouth - usually works after some work is done for the client and they are happy with it. After some time it becomes a major project source.
* Twitter - virtually impossible now, no followers;
* Conferences and meetups - TODO;
* LinkedIn - update profile, write articles, connect with people, discuss;
* Recruitment agencies;
* Freelancing platforms - [fiverr](https://www.fiverr.com/), [guru](https://www.guru.com/), [Upwork](https://www.upwork.com/), [Freelancer](https://www.freelancer.com/), [Elance](https://www.upwork.com/);
* Developer as a service platforms - [Toptal](https://www.toptal.com/), [Alt Tab](), [X-Team](https://x-team.com/), [Crew](), [Scalable Path](https://www.scalablepath.com), [Gun](https://www.gun.io/), []() - especially recommendedl;
* Micro-consulting platforms - [Airpair](https://www.airpair.com/), [Codementor](https://www.codementor.io/), [Pluralsight](https://www.pluralsight.com/) - providing help in one-on-one sessions, using video calls, screen-sharing, code-sharing.

## Applying for the project
* Write about your application and the project more than about yourself;
* Demonstrate the level of competence;
* The ability to learn fast counts;
* Do not lie about your experience, nonetheless it the lack of it could be omitted if you present yourself well;
* *I know I'm not the cheapest developer, but...*

## Communication with the client
* **Be reliable** - answer emails and questions promptly. Send regular status reports and let them know when you achieve a goal;
* **Be polite and professional**;
* **Be honest** - do not lie, keep your word. Do not promise things you cannot deliver;
* **Do not hide problems** - notify clients of any problems as soon as possible, before they get big;
* **Keep track of your time** - if you are paid by the hour, send reports. If you are paid flat rate per project, this helps you figure out the difference between estimation and actual effort.
* **Offer technical advice**;
* **Ask questions**;
* **Deliver what your clients expect, rather than what you think they expect**;
* **Solve problems**.

## Keeping your reputation
* Keep the client in the loop, anticipate their questions and provide updates;
* Solve all ambiguities upfront;
* Avoid signing an uknown non-disclosure agreement;
* Read and understand the contract;

## Downs
### Freelancer
* Expensive withdrawal;
* Project accepting costs 10% even if you reject it later;

### Upwork
* 20 % fee;
* Additional fees for terrible support;
* One dispute can block your account forever;
* Hard to compete with those who have lower costs of living;

### CrossOver
* Large discrepancies in hour rates (from $10 to $100).
* Randomly taken screenshots, if you go to the toilet in a wrong time - deduction.
* If you fail one week, they don't pay you.
* You get fired from a job without a notice.

### Toptal
* Does not show available jobs to non-member freelancers.
* 5-steps interview, 2-weeks test-project.

## Overall rules
* In order to get a job done properly, you need solid communication, a client willing to talk to you and sort you out with what you need within at least 48 hours;
* If they’re constantly bargaining to get your price down, to undervalue the work that needs to be done.
* If they try and validate a low price with the promise of ‘Long term work’.

## Long-term plan:
1. Interesting and creative work in modern technologies.
2. Work that gives opportunity and money that enables traveling for a long time.
3. Work better paid than this in Lublin.
4. Taking advantage of my personal qualities, apart from the technical ones.
