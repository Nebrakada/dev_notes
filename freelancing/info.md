## Applying for the project
* Write about your application and the project more than about yourself;
* Demonstrate the level of competence;

* Do not lie about your experience, nonetheless it the lack of it could be omitted if you present yourself well;
* *I know I'm not the cheapest developer, but...*
* 

## Communication with the client
* **Be reliable** - answer emails and questions promptly. Send regular status reports and let them know when you achieve a goal;
* **Be polite and professional**;
* **Be honest** - do not lie, keep your word. Do not promise things you cannot deliver;
* **Do not hide problems** - notify clients of any problems as soon as possible, before they get big;
* **Keep track of your time** - if you are paid by the hour, send reports. If you are paid flat rate per project, this helps you figure out the difference between estimation and actual effort.
* **Offer technical advice**;
* **Ask questions**;
* **Deliver what your clients expect, rather than what you think they expect**;
* **Solve problems**.

## Keeping your reputation
* Keep the client in the loop, anticipate their questions and provide updates;
* Solve all ambiguities upfront;
* Avoid signing an uknown non-disclosure agreement;
* Read and understand the contract;
