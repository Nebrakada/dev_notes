## Hypermedia As the Engine of Application State
`Protocol = a set of conventions governing the treatment and especially the formatting of data in an electronic communications 
system.`
`Application = computerized behavior that achieves a goal.`
`Protocol = set of legal interactions necessary to realize that behavior. Protocol lays out the interaction rules.`
`Application state = is a snapshot of the entire system at a particular instant.`
* We browse the Web by clicking links or completing and submitting fields. These interlinked pages describe a protocol - a
series of steps we take to achieve a goal.
* The essence of hypermedia - by transiting links between resources, we change the state of an application.
* Hypermedia = everyday part of our online activities; rarely used in computer-to-computer interactions.
* Hypermedia system = characterized by transfer of links in the resource representations exchanged by the participants in the
application protocol.
